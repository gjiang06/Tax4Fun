Description: The characterization of phylogenetic and functional diversity are
    key elements in the analysis of microbial communities. Amplicon-based
    sequencing of marker genes, such as 16S rRNA, is a powerful tool for
    assessing and comparing the structure of microbial communities at a high
    phylogenetic resolution. Tax4Fun predicts functional and metabolic
    capabilities of microbial communities based on 16S rRNA datasets. Tax4Fun
    allows easy processing of the output from SILVAngs
    (https://www.arb-silva.de/ngs/), QIIME (http://qiime.org/) or any other
    analysis pipeline using the SILVA database (https://www.arb-silva.de/) as
    reference. Tax4Fun provides a good approximation to functional profiles
    obtained from metagenomic shotgun sequencing approaches.
